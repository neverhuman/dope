Inspect of the artifact built for this page reports `artifact_bytes` 151, `rows_fitted` 400, three positional features, dependence `chow_liu`, and target `sparse_linear`. `compliant` is false: compile sees `train.csv` only and does not certify a release. The transcript is [examples/readme-regression/INSPECT.txt](examples/readme-regression/INSPECT.txt). This toy is not the benchmark above.

The installed public demo in [examples/public-regression](examples/public-regression/) fits the UCI Airfoil Self-Noise table (Brooks, Pope, and Marcolini; CC BY 4.0; DOI 10.24432/C5VW2C) on a grouped development split and writes one native raw-unit artifact, `model.raw` (SHA-256 `0950cbe79817…`), with profile `raw-numeric-symbolic-v1` under the byte profile `native-raw-complete-v1`. Compile, `inspect`, the demo's research receipt, and the file size all report 1,558 bytes: 56 bytes of framing, 1,080 bytes of fitted schema and transforms, and 422 bytes of sampling payload. The file is its own transport archive. The generic runtime is measured separately: the debug binary and its mapped libraries came to 72,049,152 bytes, so the cold sampling closure was 72,050,710 bytes. No portable bundle or release-build runtime was measured. The run used commit `59437b1`, and privacy, driver, and geometry checks are unmeasured for this artifact. It is an engineering conformance example on one development split, not a benchmark result, and a different object from both the toy above and the paper's `.dpk` plus `projection.json` charge. The pinned values are in [docs/whitepaper/receipts/native-byte-conformance-v1.json](docs/whitepaper/receipts/native-byte-conformance-v1.json), and the supplement repeats them.
